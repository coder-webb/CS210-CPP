# CS210-CPP
Item tracking program written in c++

Prompts and responses:
1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- This program is made to read a file of words and count the total number of times that word occurred. Then the user is prompted to search for an item which would return the number of occurrences or they can display a list or histogram of all words and the total number each word appears.

2. What did you do particularly well?
- I think I organized my code well. The creation of a menu object and an item tracker object makes perfect sense to me and even after looking at my code after some time, I find it's easy to get back into what I was thinking at the time I was writing it.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- I could enhance my code by allowing the user to enter a document to scan during runtime. I could also make scanning the words more flexible by ignoring case so that apple and APPLE both count towards the number of "apple" occurrences.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- The biggest challenge I had to overcome was clearing the buffer and ignoring everything in the buffer, up to a newline. I overcame this using a search engine. Bing AI cleared up my issue before I found it necessary to scour cpp documentation or forums.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- The use of references I think will transfer over to other projects well. After completing this project I also looked a bit more in depth at pointers and now have a fair understanding of how they work and how to use them.

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- The program is all of these qualities because it's a small, simple program. To me, it's easy to read because of how I separated the Menu and ItemTracker classes and the variables and functions that make up those classes.
